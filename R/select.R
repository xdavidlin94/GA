  #' Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection
  #'
  #' Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection. User must pass in a dataframe and integer
  #' specifying which column to use as the dependent variable. The function also allows
  #' for different fitness functions, genetic operators, and selective pressure to be applied
  #' To use GLM, specific a non-gaussian family.
  #'
  #' @param data dataframe containing dependent variable (y) and all covariates
  #' @param yColumn integer specifying which column of data is dependent variable
  #' @param fitnessFUN fitness function to use. Default is AIC
  #' @param k selective pressure for ranking. Default is 2
  #' @param geneticOperator genetic operator to use. Default is single point crossover.
  #' The function must take 2 parents and the number of features as
  #' input and return two children
  #' @param family a description of the error distribution and
  #' link function to be used in the model. Default is gaussian (standard lm()). To use
  #' glm(), specify a different family such as poisson(), etc...
  #' @param nInterations integer specifying number of iterations before stopping
  #'
  #' @return Binary vector detailing optimal features to use
  #'
  #' @examples bestFeatures <- select(data = fakeData, yColumn = 1, fitnessFUN = AIC, k = 2,
